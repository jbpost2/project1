# Before Everything

This is a project that go through the pipeline from extracting data from
public API, to processing in the RStudio, and to upload directly to the
Github as README. Data was in JSON format when imported, which provides
a great learning opportunity for JSON files; The output was directly
push to the Github, which is also a great practice of what we learned in
the class. Itâ€™s an interesting and steep learning curve, and I love it
quite a
bit.

<!-- ```{r ,echo=True,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
